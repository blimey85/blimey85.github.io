    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While trying to install <code>therubyracer</code> gem I ran into a problem where it couldn&rsquo;t find a debug file and would not build the native extension. Google reported that there is a bug in CLT 6.3 where a file is missing which is present in version 6.2. I couldn&rsquo;t seem to downgrade because I don&rsquo;t have a paid developer account so I thought I was stuck. A kind soul on [<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/29576048">http://stackoverflow.com/a/29576048</a>])(StackOverflow) found a workaround.</p>

<pre><code class="plain">echo '#define _LIBCPP_ASSERT(x, m) ((void)0)' | sudo tee -a /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1/__debug &gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>

<p>Never one to be afraid of messing with my system because hey, it&rsquo;s 2am, I&rsquo;m tired, and furthermore, what could possibly go wrong? I ran the command, typed in my system password, and all seemed well. I then tried <code>gem install therubyracer</code> and it installed, finally.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t use XCode much and didn&rsquo;t actually know the Command Line Tools were/are used by Ruby so that&rsquo;s something new to me. I also didn&rsquo;t knwo that the might Apple ever makes mistakes. Ok, I actually knew that part. They don&rsquo;t make a lot of mistakes, but not everything can be magical and just work. Thankfully I found a solution and was able to get the gems installed. Now back to my regularly scheduled late-night coding.</p>
